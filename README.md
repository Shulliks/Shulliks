### Hi there 👋🏻
This repository was created to be presented as a project to a Learning Center, with the purpose of demonstrate the acquired knowledges given on their two months course; although I had the misfortune to have to make it for the very first time in four days ((wretched crime)). 
A great opportunity 👍🏻
